The EXE of the game can be found in the dist folder. 
Download the EXE, it will throw a windows error, this is normal as it is a pygame developed game that hasn't 
been cleared through windows defender so it does throw a saftey error, if you continue through it will launch and attempt to communicate to the DB, if it is 
unscussful it will allow you to play against any of the AI's that do no require previous game data to play. 

The Database.py has been left out for now since it does have infomation to the SQL database. This file contains commands for communicating to the SQL database to 
retrieve user information, previous game data, and saving current games.
